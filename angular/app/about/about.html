        <h3>What is this?</h3>

        <p>
            We are a brand new social app centered on hashtag chatting. You can find
            a hashtag, enter and join the conversation. You can meet people, add
            friends, and build a profile. Essentially, we are a social media website
            built around upgraded, sleeker, IRC style chatrooms with awesome new
            features. If you like it, find a chat and enjoy! The lounge for the site
            is <a ui-sref="app.chat.show({title: 'Finit'})">#Finit</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the purpose of this website?</h3>

        <p>
            We wanted to create something that was popular during the early 2000s.
            That is chatting. Whatever happened to real time chat? We're slowly
            moving towards a slow, forum-based internet and we want to bring
            back real time social interaction. But we also wanted to do it better.
            The site is designed with simplicity in mind. It's easy to navigate between
            chatrooms and private messages. It's never been easier to start a new
            hashtag and grow your own community.

        <h3>What is this site built on?</h3>

        <p>
            The front end is built with <a href="//angularjs.org">AngularJs</a> and
            <a href="//material.angularjs.org/latest">Angular Material</a>. It uses
            <a href="//www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Google Material Design</a>
            concepts for a sleek modern look. The back end technologies include PHP
            and <a href="//laravel.com">Laravel</a> for CRUD operations and user
            authentication. The chat server is built with NodeJs and
            <a href="//nodejs.org">ExpressJs</a>.
